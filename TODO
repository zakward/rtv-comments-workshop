Todo:
  ☐ Create comment model
    ☐ Comment model should have ref to the User who created it and the Issue it was made on
  
  ☐ Create comment router
    ☐ Get all request vs Get by Issue id request
    ☐ We need to manage both references in the post route
    ☐ Test in Postman

  ☐ Front end implementation 
    ☐ Axios request to get comments
    ☐ Putting the comments on the page
